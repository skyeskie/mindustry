## Binary coded resource control/signaling

### Encoding basics
Operations can be complicated to store/update. There are 16 different
resources (currently) in Mindustry. The basic memory cell has only
64 slots.

### Structure
Slots 0 - 20 are reserved as follows:
- Slot 0: Bit Flags - true when resource < 100%
- Slot 1: Bit Flags - true when resource < 80%
- Slots 2 and 3 left empty currently
- Slot 4: Capacity of attached container/core
- Slots 5 - 20 have count of different resources

### Resources

The following resources, their capacity slot, and bit.

The mask can be generated by `1 << bit`

| Resource | Mem Slot | Bit | Mask |
|--------|---|---|------|
| Copper | 5 | 0 | 1 |
| Lead | 6 | 1 | 2 |
| Sand | 7 | 2 | 4 |
| Coal | 8 | 3 | 8 |
| Scrap | 9 | 4 | 16 |
| Spore Pod | 10 | 5 | 32 |
| Titanium | 11 | 6 | 64 |
| Thorium | 12 | 7 | 128 |
| Graphite | 13 | 8 | 256 |
| Silicon | 14 | 9 | 512 |
| Metaglass | 15 | 10 | 1024 |
| Pyratite | 16 | 11 | 2048 |
| Blast Compound | 17 | 12 | 4096 |
| Plastanium | 18 | 13 | 8192 |
| Phase Fabric | 19 | 14 | 16384 |
| Surge Allow | 20 | 15 | 32768 |

### Files
- `bin_cell_copy` - Propagates slots 0..20 from one memory cell to all others
- `bin_res_graph`
  - Reads from container/core
  - Graphs all 16 resources on display
  - Colored based on flag status
  - Stores to attached memory cell
- `bin_cell_write`
  - Subset of graph - updates single memory cell from containter
- `resource_auto_control`
  - Contains logic to determine which resource to check against from links
  - Uses memory cell with binary coding to get <100% flag
